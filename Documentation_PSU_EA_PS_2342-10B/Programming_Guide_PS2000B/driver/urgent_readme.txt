This driver is supplied as driver installation file (*.INF) only, which comes on this CD or as is available as download from the device manufacturers website.
The file installs the actual driver (type: CDC, Communications Device Class), which should be included in "common" Windows OS versions since Windows XP.
In case it is not included or somehow not available, the USB device can not be installed for the moment. As an alternative, there are commercial drivers available on the internet.
The installation is typical like with all driver installation procedures where the Windows driver installation dialogue request to point to the *.INF file.
